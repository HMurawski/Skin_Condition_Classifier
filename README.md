**Live demo:** https://hm-ai-skin-classifier.streamlit.app/  
**Status:** Research MVP (not a medical device)

This app classifies common skin conditions from a photo and **abstains when uncertain** (returns `uncertain/healthy` below a confidence threshold).  
It‚Äôs designed for *cautious triage*, not diagnosis.

## Motivation
As a parent, I wanted a **cautious, accessible tool** to triage rashes and frequent conditions without overconfident guesses. This project grew from that need into a small, production-like MVP with a clean ML workflow, clear metrics, and a simple UI that anyone can try.

## How it works
### Overall Flow
- **Image Input**: An image is either uploaded or selected from a sample gallery.
- **Preprocessing**: The image is resized, normalized, and its EXIF orientation is corrected.
- **Model Inference**: The processed image is fed into a **ResNet18** model.
- **Probability & Prediction**: The model outputs **Softmax probabilities**.
    - If the maximum probability is **less than a set threshold**, the result is classified as **"uncertain/healthy"**.
    - If the maximum probability is **greater than or equal to the threshold**, the corresponding class with the highest probability is the **predicted class**.
- **UI Output**: The user interface displays the result, along with a probability chart.

### Preprocessing
- **Training**: Images are augmented using `RandomResizedCrop`, `HorizontalFlip`, `Rotation`, and `ColorJitter`, followed by normalization with ImageNet mean/std.
- **Validation/Testing**: Images are simply resized and normalized.

### Model
- A **ResNet18** architecture is used, initialized with **ImageNet** pretrained weights.
- The final fully connected layer is replaced to match the number of classes.
- The model runs on the best available device (`auto/cuda/cpu`) with a deterministic seed.

### Training
- **Optimizer**: `AdamW` is used with a set learning rate (`LR`) and `weight_decay`.
- **Loss Function**: `CrossEntropyLoss` with label smoothing (0.05) and class weights (inverse frequency) is used.
- **Scheduler**: `ReduceLROnPlateau` is used to adjust the learning rate based on the validation macro-F1 score.
- **Artifacts**:
    - The best model is saved as `best_resnet18.pt`.
    - Class order is stored in `classes.txt`.
    - Per-epoch metrics (`epoch,val_acc,val_f1,lr`) are logged in `metrics.csv`.

### Evaluation
- **Process**: Logits are collected and converted to softmax probabilities.
- **Metrics**:
    - Metrics (`coverage`, `accuracy`, `macro-F1`) are reported on a "confident subset" of predictions (where `max_prob ‚â• threshold`).
    - A threshold sweep from 0.50 to 0.90 is performed to analyze the trade-off between coverage and quality.
- **Reports**: A full `classification_report` and a confusion matrix are generated for all labels.

### Inference
- The model is loaded once and cached for efficiency.
- An input PIL image is preprocessed and passed to the model to get logits and probabilities.
- If the top probability is below the threshold, the output is "uncertain/healthy". Otherwise, it returns the predicted class.
- The UI also shows the top-2 probabilities and flags "borderline cases" where the difference between the top two probabilities is less than 0.05.

### UI (Streamlit)
- **Inputs**: A gallery of sample images for each class and a file uploader.
- **Controls**: A slider to adjust the prediction abstention threshold.
- **Outputs**:
    - A bar chart of prediction probabilities.
    - A glossary of conditions.
    - Tips for taking photos.

## Data
### Supported Conditions

The model classifies 9 common dermatological conditions with high accuracy:

| Condition | Clinical Description | Key Visual Features |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Acne** | Clogged hair follicles causing inflammatory lesions | Comedones, papules, pustules on face/back |
| **Contact Dermatitis** | Allergic or irritant reaction to external substances | Localized red, itchy rash at contact site |
| **Eczema** | Chronic inflammatory skin condition | Dry, scaly patches in flexural areas |
| **Psoriasis** | Autoimmune condition with rapid skin cell turnover | Well-demarcated plaques with silvery scales |
| **Rash** | General term for widespread skin inflammation | Non-specific redness, may be viral/bacterial |
| **Scabies** | Parasitic mite infestation causing intense itching | Linear burrows, especially web spaces/wrists |
| **Tinea/Ringworm** | Fungal infection of skin, hair, or nails | Ring-shaped lesions with raised, scaly borders |
| **Urticaria** | Allergic reaction causing temporary skin welts | Raised, itchy wheals that appear/disappear |
| **Warts** | Viral skin growths caused by HPV | Small, rough-textured papules |
- DermNet-based dataset. 
- Custom stratified split 75/15/10 (train/val/test)

> **üí° Clinical Insight:** The default threshold (0.75) balances coverage and precision for practical triage scenarios. Higher thresholds prioritize accuracy over coverage, enabling "better safe than sorry" decision making in healthcare contexts.

## Safety & Limitations
- Not a medical device ‚Äî research/education only.
- Dataset bias: trained on public mixed-age images; not curated for clinical coverage.
- Image quality matters: poor lighting, blur, or distant crops degrade predictions.
- Abstention by design: the app returns uncertain/healthy when confidence < threshold.
- Out-of-distribution: rare conditions or atypical presentations may be misclassified or flagged as uncertain.
